# Credit-Default-Prediction

This is a supervised machine learning project about customer satisfaction classification from an airline. This project explore the datasets and then process it to be used for modeling. The model used in this projects are: Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Naive Bayes, and Bagging meta-estimator with Classification Report, Cross Valiadtion metrics.

In this project, we are prioritizing recall value to minimize wrong prediction of default. Based on the cross validation, Random Forest has the best average recall result. In the model improvement hyperparameter tuning is done using grid search but only small improvement are achieved. The end results were not satisfactory as the model still overfit. Further improvement is required to achieve fit result.
